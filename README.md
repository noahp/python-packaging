For a REALLY quick setup for a new package, you can use
[pyscaffold](https://github.com/blue-yonder/pyscaffold):

```bash
# for python 3
pip install pyscaffold
# for python 2.x
pip install pyscaffold==2.5
# initializes a git repo + skeleton package in a new folder 'new-package'
putup new-package
```

# Use
1. Copy the example `setup.py` and modify for your use.

2. Run the following commands from the package directory to produce the `.whl`
   package file.

```bash
# Install wheel utils if you don't already have them
pip install wheel

# To build a plain python (or if there are native extensions, a platform wheel):
python setup.py bdist_wheel
```

The `.whl` file generated can be installed with pip locally, and also uploaded
to a python package repository.

I recommend testing in a clean virtualenv (or use
[tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) ‚ú® ) to make sure any scripts or
dependencies are handled properly.

# setup.py
The informative parameter values (version, author, url, etc.) are available from
`pip show` after installing the wheel.

# Single source of version
This snippet can be added to a `setup.py` file. It grabs a `__version__` string
from the specified file, and uses it when producing the package file.

Clumsy but it works! Using scm (git semver tags) instead would require the
package to retrieve its version number from `pkg_resources` after installation.

```python
import os
import re
def get_version():
    """One of the practical options for single source of versioning. See:
    https://packaging.python.org/guides/single-sourcing-package-version/"""
    package_name = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'some-package.py')
    with open(package_name, 'r') as package:
        find_version = re.compile(r'^__version__ = [\'\"]([^\'\"]*)[\'\"]')
        for line in package.readlines():
            m = find_version.search(line)
            if m:
                return m.group(1)
    raise UserWarning('Error, unable to locate version string')
...
setup(
    ...
    version=get_version(),
    ...
)
```
